    <h1>BHTM</h1>
    <H3>What is BHTM?</h3>
    <p>BHTM stands for Bash in HTML. It's a stripped-down version of <a href="https://github.com/Supraboy981322/ELH">ELH</a> which just runs Bash instead of trying to run as many languages as possible.</p>
    <p>In case you don't know what ELH is. ELH is basically PHP, but you don't have to write PHP. When I say that, I mean embeding code in HTML which is executed by the server and replaced with the result before sending it to the client</p>
    <p>For Example, this page has zero JavaScript, all functionality is written in Bash (using BHTM, as previously stated)</p>

    <h4>Your request properties:</h4>
    <$bash

      printf "<p><b>URL:</b>  ${Url}</p>"
      printf "<p><b>Host:</b>  ${Host}</p>"
      printf "<p><b>Remote Address:</b>  ${RemoteAddr}</p>"
    $>
    <p><b>Headers:</p></b>
    <code><pre><$bash printf "${Headers}" | jq $></code></pre>
